    <h4>Step 3. Acquiring Programming Knowledge.</h4>
    <P>As a cloud engineer, it is important to understand at least one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming language</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scripting language</a>, especially for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation">automating</a> tasks and provision resources in the cloud.</P>
    <p>Know your way around Git and a product like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab.</a></p>
    <h4>Step 4. Learning Devops principles & tools.</h4>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps" target="_blank">DevOps</a> is a set of practices that aims to improve collaboration between development and operations teams and increase software delivery speed and reliability.</p>

    <h4>Step 5. Gaining Hands-On Experience</h4>
    <p>Seeking opportunities to gain practical, hands-on experience with cloud technologies is essential to becoming a successful cloud engineer.</p>
    <p>The first step is to create an account with one of the big cloud providers, AWS, Azure, or GCP.</p>
    <h4>Step 6. Earning Certifications.</h4>
    <p>Obtaining a certification can be beneficial for several reasons:</p>
